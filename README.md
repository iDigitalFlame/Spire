# Spire Java Framework

Spire is a Java6-7 framework that I wrote back in my college days. This huge package of Java files is not very usable to me anymore
but contains some cool concepts and code I designed. I have this here as an archived reference, incase anyone might find this useful.

I expect much of it to be incompatible with the current Java versions and might not work correctly.
